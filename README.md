## What is toolss™?

A curated directory of AI and productivity tools that developers actually use. You'll find no sponsored placements - just The Best™ tools that are worth your time.

## Why toolss™ is Different

- **Curated Quality**: We don't just dump every tool we find. Each submission is reviewed to ensure it's actually worth discovering.

- **Developer First**: Built by developers, for developers. The tools here are the ones we'd recommend to our team.

- **Open Source**: Community-driven and transparent. Don't like something? Submit a PR.

- **Fast as Hell**: No bloat, no unnecessary JavaScript. Just a clean, fast directory that works.

## Contributing

We built this for the community, and we want your help making it better.

## Submit a Tool

Found something worth sharing? [Submit it here](https://toolss-eight.vercel.app/submit) and help others discover it.

## Code Contributions

Want to improve the project? Here's how:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** - `git checkout -b feature/your-improvement`
3. **Write modular code** - Break things into smaller, reusable components
4. **Commit with clear messages** - Tell us what you changed and why
5. **Push to your branch** - `git push origin feature/your-improvement`
6. **Open a Pull Request** - Describe your changes in the PR title

#### Guidelines

- **Keep it modular**: No massive single files. Break components down.
- **Name things clearly**: Your code should be self-documenting.
- **Comment when needed**: If it's complex, explain it.
- **Test your changes**: Make sure nothing breaks.

## Project Structure

Keep things organized:
- Small, focused components
- Utilities in dedicated files  
- Shared types in common locations
- Configuration separate from logic

## License

MIT License - fork it, modify it, make it yours. Just keep it awesome.
